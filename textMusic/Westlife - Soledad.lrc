[00:17.52]If only you could see the tears
[00:22.09]In the world you left behind
[00:25.59]If only you could heal my heart
[00:30.17]Just one more time
[00:33.84]Even when I close my eyes
[00:38.12]There's an image of your face
[00:41.55]And once again I come to realise
[00:46.28]You're a loss I can't replace
[00:51.95]Soledad
[00:54.06]It's a keeping for the lonely
[00:58.01]Since the day that you were gone
[01:01.67]Why did you leave me
[01:03.39]Soledad
[01:06.00]In my heart you were the only
[01:10.10]And your memory lives on
[01:13.81]Why did you leave me
[01:15.54]Soledad
[01:19.82]Walking down the streets of Nothingville
[01:24.28]Where our love was young and free
[01:27.82]Can't believe just what an empty place
[01:32.01]It has come to be
[01:34.62]I would give my life away
[01:40.07]If it could only be the same
[01:43.58]Cause I can't still the voice inside of me
[01:48.29]That is calling out your name
[01:54.02]Soledad
[01:54.88]Soledad
[01:56.12]It's a keeping for the lonely
[02:00.07]Since the day that you were gone
[02:03.02]You were gone
[02:03.87]Why did you leave me
[02:05.37]Soledad
[02:08.06]In my heart you were the only
[02:11.95]And your memory lives on
[02:15.85]Why did you leave me
[02:17.49]Soledad
[02:22.66]Time will never change the things you told me
[02:30.53]After all we're meant to be
[02:34.73]Love will bring us back to you and me
[02:42.37]If only you could see
[02:48.00]Soledad
[02:48.99]Soledad
[02:50.25]It's a keeping for the lonely
[02:54.00]Since the day that you were gone
[02:57.01]You were gone
[02:57.82]Why did you leave me
[02:59.40]Soledad
[03:02.13]In my heart you were the only
[03:06.08]And your memory lives on
[03:10.02]Why did you leave me
[03:11.50]Soledad
[03:14.16]It's a keeping for the lonely
[03:18.01]Since the day that you were gone
[03:21.91]Why did you leave me
[03:23.44]Soledad
[03:26.24]In my heart you were the only
[03:30.14]And your memory lives on
[03:33.87]Why did you leave me
